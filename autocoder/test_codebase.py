Create unit tests for the `Codebase` class. This should include tests for initialization, `list_files_in_bot_branch`, `clear_cache`, `create_pull_request`, `get_active_branch`, `get_issues`, `create_branch`, `read_file`, `read_files`, `create_file`, and `update_file` methods. Ensure to mock `github_api` object's methods using a testing framework like `unittest.mock`. Each test should assert the expected behavior of the `Codebase` methods, such as correct data being returned, correct calls to the `github_api`, and proper handling of edge cases. Import necessary testing and mocking libraries at the top of the file.
